This assignment was pretty easy for me at first. I already knew about 99%  of the code I had to put down but as always with most of my projects I couldn't get it to function correctly. I'm guessing that there's something that like one letter or number off somewhere but the console isn't giving me any errors and I made the mistake of leaving this for the last possible second on Monday so I can't consult the Discord for help so I'm just going to leave it where it is and take care of it along with whatever we're doing next week. Initially I also had trouble keeping track of the various answers and where they led to and stuff because all of the code looks pretty much the same and I always lay down the base stuff first and then fill it in with actual information later rather than working from top to bottom with everything because that seems to overwhelming to me but I was able to keep track of everything by leaving little // notes for myself everywhere which was really handy because I could write down codes for what's connected without messing up the actual work. I'm excited to learn what I messed up for next week.
