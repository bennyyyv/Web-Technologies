This assignment went really well for me. I understood everything that I needed to put down the only issue I ran in to was just keeping myself organized. It could just be that I left all of my coding homework for the last day and have been staring at a screen all day getting it done or it could just be the naming but I had a really hard time figuring out where I was in my story and what variables I had set up and what I still needed to make. Luckily, knowing about the console helped me solve a lot of the problems because it told me what was wrong and the addition of the Live Server package made it really easy to run through my story and find button and text box issues.
