This was a tough assignment for me. Apparently I have forgotten a lot of what I had learned in my previous web design classes because this took me way longer than I feel like it should have. With that being said, I really enjoy the problem solving nature of these web design projects and I was able to learn a few new techniques in order to complete this assignment. I hope that by the end of this class I will be able to create a website that looks like the examples I saw when I was researching hero images and other one page websites.
